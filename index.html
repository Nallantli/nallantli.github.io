        <h1>NALLANTLI</h1>
        <p>
            Welcome to my personal profile page. There's not all that much to see around here, but you are welcome to take a look around. You'll find here a nice brief overview of my work and interests, and perhaps something interesting to carry back home.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am a Linguistics Major at the University of Florida, and will be graduating at the end of this year (2020). Despite majoring in Linguistics, I have a long and fortunate history with programming and Computer Science, which I continue to act in as a hobby
            along with my linguistics studies. In certain cases, the worlds do collide, but for the most part unless something calls for computational linguistics specifically they remain separate.

        <h1>NAME</h1>
        <p>
            My real name is Benjamin R. Park, but on the internet I have taken up the username <b>Nallantli</b> [<span class="IPA">ˈnaːl.lãːn.tɬi</span>] (or, Anglicized as [<span class="IPA">nəˈlãnt.li</span>], or [<span class="IPA">nəˈlãn.(t)ʃi</span>]),
            a calque of the Nahuatl postpositions <b>nâl + tlân</b>, meaning "to the other side" and "from; at" respectively, plus the additional <b>tli</b> nominalizer so that my name is indeed a regular noun. The meaning roughly translates to "(he/it)
            is from the other side (of something)." I like to consider this pseudonym to be a reflection of my two contrasting interests, the social aspects of learning and studying languages and the analytics of Linguistics and Computer Science. Additionally,
            I just think it sounds cool.
        </p>
        <p>
            Many people who have spoken to me for an extended period of time on the internet (approximately two years ago I made the switch) refer to me as <b>Aggy</b>, an abbreviation of my former username <b>Agilulfulus</b>, taken as a dimunitive form
            of Italo Calvino's eponymous character Agilulf from the novel <b>The Nonexistent Knight</b>.
